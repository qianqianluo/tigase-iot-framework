"Tigase IoT One is a system designed to bring the Internet of Things into "
"your home securely, quickly, and to devices you may never have thought "
"possible! It is based of of Tigase’s open source software, and provides "
"an open easy-to-program interface for adding your own devices to the IoT "
"one Cloud network. Devices can be added and removed with a few taps, with"
" one password for anything you add. The software allows for unlimited use"
" on a local network, and provides multiple methods for you to do it on a "
"remote network. To find out more, read on!"

"Tigase IoT One Cloud uses XMPP for transmission of data between client "
"and the IoT hub. XMPP stands for eXtensible Messaging and Presence "
"Protocol, an evolution of the Jabber platform. It is an Open source "
"standard recognized by the IETF under publications `RFC 3920 "
"<https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html>`__ and `3921 "
"<https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3921.html>`__. XMPP is an excellent real-time "
"communication platform with a proven track record in a wide variety of "
"industries. As a natural extension of the way XMPP works, communication "
"to your IoT devices connected with this system are improved thanks to a "
"level of abstraction. Unlike most IoT solutions where a client connects "
"to a host program on a device directly, IoT One Cloud uses a modified "
"XMPP server to stand in between and deliver only properly formatted "
"commands and packets to and from the devices, ensuring security from "
"rogue program injections."

"An electronic circuit is simply a path for electron flow. It must consist"

"electron flow from Positive(+) to Negative(-). Also keep in mind that we "
"will generally be dealing with DC or Direct Current. This means that the "
"positive and negative sides of a circuit are discreet and do not change "
"(where as an Alternating Current circuit flips back and forth). This mean"
