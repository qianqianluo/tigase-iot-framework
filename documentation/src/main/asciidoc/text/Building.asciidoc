=== Building Framework

==== Gradle
Tigase IoT Framework binaries can be built with Gradle.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publish publishToMavenLocal distZip

This line will compile whole framework (including Raspberry Pi releated stuff), install it to Gradle and Maven repositories and create simplest possible bundle of a framework with only most necessary features.
This bundle will be created in a directory `runtime/build/distributions/`.

=== Building Web UI
Web UI for Tigase IoT Framework module which can be found in `client` subdirectory requires maven for building.

[source,bash]
-----
mvn package
-----

This will create WAR package in `target` subdirectory.
