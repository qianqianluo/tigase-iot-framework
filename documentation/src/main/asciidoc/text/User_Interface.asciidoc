== User interface

In `client` module of this project there is ready to use web based user interface with support for
handling devices provided by us.

Web client is capable of:

=== Authentication and registration

Client can connect to Tigase IoT Hub using WebSocket or BOSH protocol with support for authentication.
It will automatically detect runnning Tigase IoT Hub in the local network and will connect to it.

=== Adding devices

You may add new devices by clicking on `Add device` button, selecting instance of IoT framework from the list of connected
framework hosts and then filling forms provided by Web UI.

=== Device reconfiguration

Almost every device is somehow configurable, ie. sensors can allow you to change how often read is
made, while intelligent executor devices may allow you to configure how they react on change of state
of other sensors.
