== User interface

In `client` module of this project there is ready to use web based user interface with support for
handling devices provided by us.

Web client is capable of:

=== Authentication

Client can connect to XMPP server using WebSocket or BOSH protocol with support for authentication
which allows you to provide additional security for IoT devices connected to XMPP server.

TIP: To authenticates using ANONYMOUS authentication leave `XMPP ID` and `Password` fields empty. This will authenticate you using anonymous authentication with domain same as a server name in `Connection URL`.

TIP: To be able to view and modify devices you need to authenticate with XMPP server admin account credentials or properly <<xmpp-server-configuration,configure>> a XMPP server.

=== Displaying devices and data

In user interface you can easily show list of attached devices, it's names and current device state
data reported from device in easy to understand way.

=== Listing actions for devices

To execute any action of device or reconfigure device just click on a device icon display on a list.
Context menu assigned to this device with proper action will appear.

=== Renaming devices

By default devices are reported with identifiers or names provided by manufacturer however using
device context menu in UI you can change device names to more meaningful.

=== Device reconfiguration

Almost every device is somehow configurable, ie. sensors can allow you to change how often read is
made, while intelligent executor devices may allow you to configure how they react on change of state
of other sensors.

=== Changing state of a device

Some of devices provice more that just it's current value, ie. executor devices like +Lights dimmer+
can allow you to set change it state

=== Adjusts to display size
