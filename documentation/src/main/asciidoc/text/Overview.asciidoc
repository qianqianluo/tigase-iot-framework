runtime:: Contains main classes of a framework. It is responsible for connectivity and general functionalities.
devices:: Provides API and base classes for implementations of sensors or executor devices.
devices-rpi:: Provides support for particular sensors or executors which are supported on Raspberry Pi platform. It is responible for communication between framework and actual devices connected to Raspberry Pi.
client:: Web based UI for interaction with devices, including device management task
client-library:: Library for interaction with application using Tigase IoT Framework installed and running on a device using XMPP protocol with support for GWT compilation. It provides classes used by UI.
